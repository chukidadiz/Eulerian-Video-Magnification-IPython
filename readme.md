# Eulerian Video Magnification IPython notebook

IPython notebook designed for [EE 120&#58; Signals ans Systems](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee120/fa16/), that employs Fourier Transform, bandpass filter, and up/down sampling to magnify subtle changes in a video to [reveal pulses and baby breathing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9ASH8IBJ2U). Designed to apply basic toolset to solve real problems.

Here are the accompanying [concept questions](/archive/python_evm.pdf) for teaching.
